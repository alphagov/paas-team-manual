# Development process

![Illustration of changes being promoted to prod](../diagrams/development-process.svg)

- The Product Manager makes decisions on what work (features, bugs) is
  prioritised
- The team make the necessary changes in their own development environments and
  branches
- The changes are [reviewed](#pull-requests) by an engineer
- The reviewer merges the changes into the master branch of the repository
- The latest revision of the code is automatically tested using the Cloud
  Foundry smoke and acceptance tests to ensure that basic user functions still
  work.
- The changes are deployed to the staging and production environments.

The diagram below shows how this process is implemented using git tags. It does
not show some planned improvements, such as using git commit signatures to
ensure that commits have been reviewed before deploying them.

# Pairing

We pair on all stories to ensure that people don't get stuck on the same
types of work and that there is a good distribution of knowledge across the
team. We aim to rotate pairs regularly by:

- changing pairs when you've been on a story for more than 2 days

- joining someone on an existing story that doesn't have a pair instead of
  picking up new work

Please tick the [pair stair][] on our board when you rotate so that rotation
are evenly distributed.

# Story kick-off

Kick-offs are an opportunity to clarify the scope of a story and raise any
technical suggestions or concerns before work starts. They should include a
check if the story being kicked off will likely conflict with any of the
stories already in progress and therefore likely cause conflicts.

If the story is a spike, it should be made clear what the questions we want to answer
are, and what specific outputs we need to cover in the summary at the end of the spike. Spikes *must* be
reviewed after 2 days.

When a pair starts a new story they should arrange a kick-off with the Product
Owner or Business Analyst, Tech Arch or Tech Lead, and anyone else from the team
that is interested. Slack is a good way to let the team know.


# Commit messages

Commit messages are very useful as documentation, so please take time to
detail what you are changing and more importantly why. The [GDS git style
guide][] explains this in more detail.

[GDS git style guide]: https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md

If something is worth detailing in a pull request description then it is
also worth detailing in a commit message. Commit messages will live with the
repository forever and can be discovered using [git pickaxe][], whereas over
time a project may move from GitHub or Pivotal Tracker. You can often
copy/paste well written commit messages to form the pull request
description.

[git pickaxe]: http://www.philandstuff.com/2014/02/09/git-pickaxe.html

# Pull requests

We peer review all code to ensure that it works as expected and is clear for
the team to understand. All work, no matter how small, should use git
branches and GitHub pull requests. [Anna's blog post][] explains how to
raise a good pull request.

[Anna's blog post]: http://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/good-pull-requests.html
[this template]: https://github.com/alphagov/paas-cf/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

When you create a pull request please:

- use [this template][] for the description so that it is easier for
  the reviewer to understand and test your changes

- prefix the subject with the story ID from Pivotal Tracker (format:
  `[#12345678] My pull request`) so that we have a record of all the changes
  for a given story

- put the pull request URL into the Pivotal Tracker story so that
  people can find it and understand the progress of a story before it is
  merged

There is a dashboard near our desks that displays open pull requests using
[Fourth Wall][]. Reviewing outstanding pull requests should be a priority
over picking up new work. As the author of a pull request you may still need
to chase this and you need to watch your email for comments on your pull
request. Pull requests should be reviewed by somebody that hasn't already
worked on the story. When reviewing a pull request please "assign" yourself
on GitHub, so that someone else doesn't duplicate effort.

[Fourth Wall]: https://github.com/alphagov/fourth-wall

# Merging Pull requests

Pull requests must be merged using a GPG signed commit. This means that merges
can't be done in the Github UI, and have to be done locally.

## Initial setup for signing commits

Ensure you have gpg setup on your machine (see [guides/GPG](../guides/GPG) for
details).

By default, git will look for a secret key in your local keyring that exactly
matches your configured committer name and email address (eg
`Testy McTest <test@example.com>`). If this is not sufficient, you can
configure the signing key that git will use:

```sh
# To apply to all git repos:
git config --global user.signingkey <key_id>

# ... or to apply to the current repo only:
git config user.signingkey <key_id>
```

Add your public key to your Github account
([https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)) so that
Github can verify commits that you sign as described
[here](https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification).

## Merging a branch into master

We have implemented a helper script to handle merging PR in some repos (eg
paas-cf). For these repos PRs can be merged and signed by doing:

```sh
make merge_pr PR=<n>
```

Where `n` is the PR number.

### Manually merging and signing a PR

For other repos PRs will need to be manually merged and signed once review is
complete, and all status checks have passed (Travis etc).

First check that your working directory is clean, then do the following:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only origin master
git merge --no-ff -S -m "Merge pull request #<n> from alphagov/repo-name\n\n<pr_title>" origin/<branch_name>
git push origin master
```

# Story summary

When you've finished a story please take a few minutes to summarise your
work in a comment on the Pivotal story. Summarising
the story will help other people in the team review it, either against the
acceptance criteria or for future reference, which can otherwise be
difficult if comments are sparse or inconsistent.

## Spike summary

The summary is particularly important if the story was a spike. If applicable
it must indicate follow up work that is required. Listing options uncovered during
the spike is good. Indicate which option is preferable. Where possible follow up stories
should be noted. Doing this allows the Product Manager prioritise the follow up work.

# Story sign-off

## What sign-off is

When the work on a story is completed and any changes merged to master, we
check that it met the original business need that motivated the story and that
acceptance criteria have been met.

We ensure that if the story changed scope, identified other problems that need
to be solved, or incurred technical debt, that stories have been created to
capture the remaining work.

If the changes have already been tested to your satisfaction during review,
then sign-off need not include testing.

## Who signs off stories

Who can sign off the story is agreed and recorded in the story at kick-off, but
by default will be the Product Manager. The Product Manager can delegate
signing off specific stories to civil servants within the team.

When a story moves to awaiting sign-off column on the board, The Tech Lead and
Tech Arch should confirm if they are happy with the story in a comment on
Pivotal Tracker to provide guidance to the person signing off.

# Work In Progress Limits

We use [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) to track work, and follow work in progress limits for the different stages of the story. We have a physical board, and use pivotal tracker for online tracking.

### Backlog
_Work In Progress Limit : NA_

These stories are ready to be played. They require a kickoff before moving to the next stage.

### Doing / Started
_Work In Progress Limit : 6_

These stories have been started by a pair and kickoff has been completed.

### Reviewing / Finished
_Work In Progress Limit : 3_

These stories have been finished and are awaiting review by another team member. The lower work in progress limit is to ensure work is reviewed promptly and completed.

### Approving / Delivered
_Work In Progress Limit : 5_

These stories have been reviewed, and code merged to master. The work in progress limit here is to allow for the limited availability of the Product Manager, and reflects the fact that work at this stage is already merged and deployed.

### Done / Delivered
_Work In Progress Limit : âˆž_

These stories have been accepted by an appropriate Approver. No limit on the ammount of stories that are done.

# Creating and forking repos

Nearly all of our code repos are public on GitHub.com because we are [coding
in the open][]. There is an exception to this, where a public repo could
risk leaking sensitive information. When creating or forking a new repo you
will need to do the following. If you're a contractor then you'll need to
ask a permanent member of the team to do this for you:

[coding in the open]: https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/

1. Prefix the name with `paas-` so that it's easier to find. This includes
forks of third-party repos which will need to be renamed after forking, e.g.
`cf-release` would become `paas-cf-release`.
1. Add the Pivotal Tracker service integration/hook. You will need to take
the API key from the "Profile" page of your own account.
1. Add the following teams:
    1. `[team] Government PaaS readonly`: the dashboard user which has
`org:read` privileges to find all of our repos.
    1. `[team] Government PaaS - People`: all members of the team that are
contractors and aren't members of the `owners` team. These should be given write
access.

We should never pull request against the `master` branch of a forked repo.
Doing so makes it very hard to reconcile our changes against the upstream
repo at a later date. We should aim to submit all changes upstream. It may
be appropriate to run against a branch of our fork for a limited period of
time.
