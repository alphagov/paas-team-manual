Some key information to help new starters to find their way.

# Repos

These are the key repos that we use. There will be many others, which these
depend on, but this list should be enough to get you started.

# URLs

These are the tools/services we use. The list roughly translates to things
that new starters will need to be added to and leavers will need to be
removed from.

# Events

These are key events that happen each fortnightly sprint. You'll get
calendar invites that detail the actual times and locations.

- Stand-up is at 09:30 every morning. We'll talk briefly about progress,
blockers, and pair rotation. Please be on time and keep it succinct. There
is time for more detailed conversations immediately afterwards.
- Planning is at the beginning of a sprint. Most of the stories
will already be prioritised in the backlog and we don't do sizing. We'll
talk about what's coming up and anything that we've missed.
- Retrospective is at the end of a sprint. It's an opportunity
to talk about what went well and what we can improve as a team. We review
and record actions in [this document][].
- Show & tell is at the end of a sprint. This is technical and
for the purpose of knowledge sharing in the team, rather than people outside
the team. We'll vote on stories from the last sprint that we want to hear
more about and one person will present each, preferably with a demo.
