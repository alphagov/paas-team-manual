<p>Tips for responding to alerts when you are on support.</p>
<h2 id="failed-logins">Failed logins</h2>
<p>In case of security incident, for example when alerted of a brute-force attack by datadog monitors,
it may help to look at UAA logs.</p>

<p>The access logs is on the UAA VMs in <code>/var/vcap/sys/log/uaa/localhost_access.log</code>.</p>

<p>All other logs are sent to <a href="https://logsearch.cloud.service.gov.uk">logsearch</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scope to component: UAA</li>
<li>Look for strings like <code>UserNotFound</code>, <code>PrincipalAuthenticationFailure</code> or <code>UserAuthenticationFailure</code></li>
<li><code>principal=XXX</code> will give you the username</li>
<li><code>origin=[1.2.3.4]</code> will give you the origin IP</li>
<li><code>UserAuthenticationSuccess</code> will give you the successful attempts

<ul>
<li>Google authentication origin will show <code>sessionId=XXX</code></li>
<li>non Google authentication origin will show <code>clientId=cf</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cpu-credits">CPU credits</h2>
<p>These alerts tell us when an AWS instance that has burstable CPU performance
has exhausted its credits and is performing badly. This is an informational
alert that should help you understand why other alerts may be triggered at
the same time. For more information about CPU credits see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-instances.html#t2-instances-cpu-credits">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-instances.html#t2-instances-cpu-credits</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cdn-broker-healthy">CDN broker healthy</h2>
<p>The CDN broker has a healthcheck endpoint which confirms whether all of its
dependencies are working. If any are not working then the healthcheck
endpoint returns a 500 response code and response body containing the
errors.</p>

<p>The version of the DataDog agent that we currently use doesn&rsquo;t report the
response body, which can make it hard to determine the actual problem. To
get this information you will need to SSH to any Cloud Foundry VM and query
the endpoint yourself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bash# bosh-ssh api/0

</code></pre></div><h2 id="rds-failures">RDS Failures</h2>
<p>On rare occasion, we may get an RDS Failure event coming through to our Datadog
via the RDS Integration. Unfortunately, many types of <code>failure</code> event are not
resolvable without getting in touch with AWS. In some circumstances you may be
able to restore an instance using <a href="/guides/Restoring_the_CF_databases/">our point-in-time-restore
instructions</a>.</p>

<p>When <code>failure</code> monitor triggers, before starting any further investigation and
work, we would like to notify our users of odd behaviour and let them know
we&rsquo;re working to solve this issue. Please see the <a href="#how-to-obtain-organisation-managers">How to obtain organisation
managers</a> to learn who to contact.</p>

<p>For more information on the 8 types of <code>failure</code> event, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.html#USER_Events.Messages">Amazon RDS
Event Categories and Event
Messages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rds-disk-utilisation">RDS Disk utilisation</h2>
<p>Our tenants are likely to run low on storage on their RDS instances over time.
This is no reason to panic, but we would like to notify our users when this
happens.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should retrieve a GUID of an instance from the tags associated
with the metrics on the alert. Having that will help you establish the users to
contact, as they may wish to scale up their instance in response. Please see
the <a href="#how-to-obtain-organisation-managers">How to obtain organisation managers</a>
to learn who to contact.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-obtain-organisation-managers">How to obtain organisation managers</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve prepared a script to obtain organisation, space, instance name and the
list of managers connected to the instance you&rsquo;re after.</p>

<p>From <code>paas-cf</code> repository, run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>./scripts/get-instance-details.sh <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RDS_INSTANCE_ID</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="api-latency">API Latency</h2>
<p>Last time we received an alert for API latency, it was a UAA bug that caused
instances to leak memory. It also resulted in high CPU usage and the quickest
solution to restoring the platform was to restart both instances one after the
other.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">PAAS_BOOTSTRAP_DIR</span><span class="k">}</span>
<span class="nv">DEPLOY_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>prod make prod bosh-cli
bosh restart uaa <span class="c"># You may want/need to target an instance, e.g. uaa/23888ebf-2dd3-4afe-b370-51705403d423</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There may be different reasons for the latency to drop down on any of the VMs.
We found out the issue by logging into the VM itself and dig through the logs.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">PAAS_BOOTSTRAP_DIR</span><span class="k">}</span>
<span class="nv">DEPLOY_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>prod make prod bosh-cli
bosh ssh uaa/23888ebf-2dd3-4afe-b370-51705403d423
tail <span class="nt">-1000</span> /var/vcap/sys/log/uaa/uaa.log
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the case of the UAA latency incident, it turned out that the CF Upgrade we
did previously, contained a UAA release introducing the memory leak. The
solution was to upgrade UAA release on its own.</p>

<p>Read more in the
<a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1275640/stories/151808174">UAA Downtime investigation</a>
story.</p>
<h2 id="intermittent-elb-failures">Intermittent ELB failures</h2>
<p>Users have previously experienced intermittent request timeouts and errors when
accessing their apps. During a particular incident, we believe that requests
timed out due to ELB node failures.</p>

<p>We publish two metrics:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>aws.elb.unhealthy_node_count</code> - number of IPs that failed to respond to an HTTP request</li>
<li><code>aws.elb.healthy_node_count</code>   - number of IPs that responded as expected</li>
</ol>

<p>Details of the monitoring approach can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/alphagov/paas-cf/blob/master/tools/metrics/README.md">the README for our monitoring application</a>.</p>

<p>We have been advised by AWS that if we believe we are experiencing an issue
with one or more ELB nodes that we should raise a &ldquo;high priority&rdquo; support
ticket with them.</p>

<p>To obtain the IP address of the failing node(s), you should inspect the logs of
the paas-metrics app. This is deployed to the &lsquo;monitoring&rsquo; space of the &#39;admin&rsquo;
org. You should see logs such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>2017-12-01T14:14:09.68+0000 [APP/PROC/WEB/0] OUT
{
    "timestamp":"1512137649.686135292",
    "source":"metrics",
    "message":"metrics.elb-node-failure",
    "log_level":1,
    "data":{
        "addr":"52.31.169.122:443",        &lt;-- this is the ELB node IP
        "err":"bad error happened!",
        "start":"2017-12-01T14:14:09.679602987Z",
        "stop":"2017-12-01T14:14:09.679602987Z"
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XUH42lgt86q2XGZY1uosb0M44vtnpeyREDJlyfxs72w/edit#heading=h.bac2cwm6xa89">Incident Report</a>.</p>
<h2 id="invalid-certificates">Invalid Certificates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphagov/paas-cf/blob/master/tools/metrics/README.md">paas-metrics</a>
exposes two metrics relating to certificate validity:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tls.certificates.validity</code> - number of days before expiry of the platform&rsquo;s public-facing certificates</li>
<li><code>cdn.tls.certificates.validity</code> - number of days before expiry of certificates for CloudFront aliases (tenants&rsquo; custom domain names). This is for all CDNs, not just those created by the broker.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the endpoints are misconfigured or the certificate is considered invalid for
some other reason the value will fall to <code>0</code> and alert as expired/invalid.</p>

<p>If the certificates are due to expire, check AWS Certificate Manager for the validation settings, as they should
validate automatically via DNS. For CDN certificates start with the CDN Broker&rsquo;s logs to investigate why
they failed to renew via Let&rsquo;s Encrypt.</p>

<p>If you are seeing <code>NO_DATA</code> errors for this monitor then there may be a more
fundimental connectivity issue to the reported endpoint.</p>

<p>The <code>cf logs</code> output of the paas-metrics app may contain additional
information. This is deployed to the &#39;monitoring&rsquo; space of the &#39;admin&rsquo; org.</p>
<h2 id="logsearch-elk-queue-threshold-limits">Logsearch/ELK queue threshold limits</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-boshrelease">Logsearch (ELK
Stack)</a> to process the CF
logs.  Logsearch would accept messages from <em>ingestors</em> that store the raw
messages in a <em>Redis queue</em>, from where they be processed by <em>parsers</em> to then
store them in <em>Elasticsearch</em>.
The ingestors are configured to stop sending logs (dropping any incoming
message) when the queue size reaches a <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/logsearch-boshrelease/blob/v203.0.0/jobs/ingestor_syslog/spec#L61-L63">given threshold</a>.</p>

<p>The size of the Logsearch redis queue <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/paas-datadog-for-cloudfoundry-boshrelease/pull/21">is exposed as a metric using the Datadog agent</a>,
and consumed by a Datadog monitor that warns if we reach 100k messages, which
gives some hours of leverage for the average of 200-300k messages in
production.</p>

<p>If the metric reaches <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/logsearch-boshrelease/blob/v203.0.0/jobs/ingestor_syslog/spec#L61-L63">the value defined as threshold</a>,
the logsearch stack is dropping messages, which jeopardises our capacity to
troubleshoot the platform.</p>

<p>The queue can start filling when the parsers are not able to process the jobs fast enough. Common cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Elasticsearch cluster is having problems and slow accepting new writes from the parser.</li>
<li>If the <code>parser</code> jobs/VMs have problems or are at capacity and cannot process messages fast enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>To perform some basic troubleshooting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/notebook/27407/Elasticsearch%20master%20CPU%20(copy)">health of the Elastisearch cluster in this Datadog notebook</a></li>
<li>Connect Elasticsearch cluster as described below to troubleshoot the cluster.</li>
<li>If Kibana is accessible, try to identify any noisy logs. High logs volume might be a symptom
of problems in other parts of the platform</li>
<li>Restarting parser, queue or ingesters is in general safe.</li>
<li>To restart the Elasticsearch nodes, follow the instructions below to disable shard reallocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connecting-to-the-elasticsearch-cluster">Connecting to the Elasticsearch cluster</h3>
<p>In order to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster, you can use a SSH tunnel using
the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/paas-bootstrap">paas-bootstrap</a> tooling:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>make prod DEPLOY_ENV=prod tunnel TUNNEL=9200:10.0.16.10:9200
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Elasticsearch cluster uses the IPs <code>10.0.16.10</code>, <code>10.0.17.10</code> and <code>10.0.18.10</code>.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm">Elasticsearch Head Chrome extension</a> to interact with the cluster.</p>
<h3 id="disabling-elasticsearch-cluster-shard-reallocation">Disabling Elasticsearch cluster shard reallocation</h3>
<p>When <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_rolling_restarts.html">restarting the Elasticsearch cluster we must disable the shard reallocation</a> to
avoid triggering a shard failover, which would seriously impact the cluster performance.</p>

<p>To do so, you can configure the tunnel in each node as mention before and execute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings' -d '{
"transient" : {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "none"
}}'
</code></pre></div>
<p>To enable it again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings' -d '{
"transient" : {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "all"
}}'
</code></pre></div><h2 id="trusted-advisor-warnings">Trusted Advisor Warnings</h2>
<p>If you see a warning from Trusted Advisor it should be addressed.</p>

<ul>
<li>IAM: Access keys should be rotated every 90 days, you should chase the owner
of the offending key, delete the key or you can use <a href="https://github.com/keymon/aws_key_management/blob/master/rotate_access_keys.sh">this script</a>
to help with rotating keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following Trusted Advisor checks cause expected warnings:</p>

<ul>
<li>S3 Bucket Permission&rsquo;s for <code>gds-paas-*-cdn-broker-challenge</code> are required to be publicly accesible so it is safe to mark these as excluded.</li>
<li>S3 Bucket Permission&rsquo;s for <code>gds-paas-*-ci-releases</code> are required to be publicly accesible so it is safe to mark these as excluded.</li>
<li>S3 Bucket Permission&rsquo;s for <code>gds-paas-*-ci-releases-blobs</code> are required to be publicly accesible so it is safe to mark these as excluded.</li>
<li>ELB Listener Security for <code>*-ssh-proxy</code>: This ELB is in TCP mode and so this warning is expected</li>
<li>Security Group - Specified Ports Unrestricted for <code>*-sshproxy</code>: We intentionally allow port 2222 for <code>cf ssh</code> access so it is safe to mark this as excluded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gorouter-high-latency-alerts">Gorouter high latency alerts</h2>
<p>If you see an alert for gorouter latency being high;</p>

<ul>
<li>Check with the team if we have any known load testing occuring either by the team or by a tenant</li>
<li>Visit <a href="https://logsearch.cloud.service.gov.uk/">kibana</a> and filter by <code>@source.component: gorouter</code> then add in <code>gorouter.host</code> to the table, this will show you which hosts are being most used currently</li>
<li>Contact the team who own the service to see if they are aware of anything happening</li>
</ul>

<p>As this is the first monitor of this type please investigate the gorouters to discover the issue they are encountering. We have previously seen high resource usage (CPU and Memory) these should be checked in the first case.</p>
