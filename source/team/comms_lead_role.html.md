# Comms lead role - PaaS Incidents

## What to do first:
Learn about [Pagerduty](/team/pagerduty/)

1. Pagerduty calls/alerts you
1. Go on Slack - PaaS incident channel (and PaaS internal channel)
1. Set up a hangout for you and the engineer (add tenant only if it will be useful)
1. Make a copy of the [incident report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2F6TLrrKTuDkYCtkW4DXryiaPoGDPmrZ-b2Teibjvo/) name the document and start to fill it in
1. Record the timeline of events as they happen in the incident report

## Statuspage - creating an incident:

Learn about [Statuspage](/team/statuspage/)

1. [StatusPage.io](https://www.statuspage.io/) - log in and create an incident (name it)
1. Select 'apply template' (for example, possible issue being investigated/we’re having an incident)
1. Fill in the template with relevant details
1. You can choose the components (for example, API, apps, billing) that are affected
1. Select 'send notifications' to email tenants. If it’s a small issue, you may not want to send them a notification (in this case, only our status page will be updated)
1. The subscribers on statuspage will get the notifications

## If you need to escalate to SMT on call:
