# Responding to AWS alerts

AWS now sends alerts to the teams mailing lists. These include:

- Billing alerts
- Notification that Amazon has detected that an access key is publicly available
- EC2 Instances scheduled for retirement

You can check and subscribe to these alerts in each corresponding mailing list page (Google Groups):
