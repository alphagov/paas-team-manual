# How to use GPG

Some of our projects use [GPG][] to encrypt secrets so that they can only be
decrypted by members of the team. These instructions may be useful if you
haven't used GPG recently or ever at all.

[GPG]: https://www.gnupg.org/

## Install

On MacOS:

    brew install gpg

On Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gnupg-agent pinentry-curses

## Generate keypair

To generate a new public and private keypair:

    gpg --gen-key

You should choose a key size of 4096 bits. The other defaults are OK to
accept.

## Publish key

Public keyservers are a simple way of distributing your public key so that
other people can download it and encrypt content for you.

Note: the following commands use the full fingerprint ID because there is a
risk of clashes when using the shortened last 8 digits (which is the
default).

To list your keys:

    gpg -K --fingerprint

The output will look something like the following:

    sec   4096R/22652456 2013-02-06
          Key fingerprint = 9562 E7AD 3A95 E7BC 708D  036F F894 D400 2265 2456
    uid                  Dan Carley (Government Digital Service) <dan.carley@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>
    ssb   4096R/233AD793 2013-02-06

Take the long ID listed after `Key fingerprint =` and run:

    gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 'YOUR ID HERE â€¦'

You will need to provide the same ID to an existing member of the team so
that they can add you to any secret stores that you need access to.

## Setup agent

If you're accessing several secrets in quick succession then it can be
frustrating to be prompted for your password multiple times. You can
configure `gpg-agent`, which is similar in concept to `ssh-agent`, to cache
your password for a short period of time.

Write the following to your shell initialisation (such as `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc`) to load `gpg-agent` each time you start a new shell:

    if which gpg-agent >/dev/null; then
      GPG_ENV_FILE="${HOME}/.gnupg/gpg-agent.env"
      if ! pgrep gpg-agent >/dev/null; then
        gpg-agent --daemon --write-env-file "${GPG_ENV_FILE}" >/dev/null
      fi
      if [ -f "${GPG_ENV_FILE}" ]; then
        source "${GPG_ENV_FILE}"
        export GPG_AGENT_INFO
      fi
    fi

Configure gpg to use the agent automatically by uncommenting the `use-agent`
line in your `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`.

## Aborting pinentry

If you abort out of the `pinentry` password prompt by using `^C` then it can
leave your shell and GPG in an unusable state. Symptoms include:

- any characters you type appear as `*`
- output from commands is incorrectly line breaked
- subsequent calls to `gpg` hang

You can fix this by killing any outstanding `pinentry` processes:

    pkill -9 pinentry

And resetting your terminal with:

    reset
