# BOSH

We use [BOSH](https://bosh.io/) for software packaging, release management, and
virtual machine (VM) lifecycle management.

BOSH runs as a single instance per environment and runs the following
components:

- BOSH director
- User account and authentication (UAA)
- CredHub
- [BOSH auditor](/monitoring_alerting/audit/)
- [AWS logging agent](/monitoring_alerting/audit/)

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram showing BOSH director and colocated components: sshd, Director, UAA, CredHub](/diagrams/bosh.svg)

## Components

### BOSH Director

The BOSH director has an API which we connect to using a reverse proxy (nginx)
through a SOCKS proxy managed by SSH.

### CredHub

CredHub has an API which we connect to through a SOCKS proxy managed by SSH.

### UAA

Operators and components on the BOSH director use UAA.

Colocated components talk to UAA directly using the TLS certificate generated by BOSH.

Operators use Google single sign-on (SSO) to authenticate with UAA, using an Amazon
load balancer which is accessible through the VPN or office network.
They do not use the SOCKS proxy because that requires users to sign in through a web browser.
