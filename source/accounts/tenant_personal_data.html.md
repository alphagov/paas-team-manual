# Tenant Personal Data

We store a small amount of personal data belonging to people who have PaaS accounts.

Under data protection legislation people have the right to obtain a copy of
that data by making a Subject Access Request. From May 2018, when the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect, they will have the right to have it
corrected or updated.

Our [team procedure for handling such requests can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dZL3rJ3NDmXNm5e9oBK6DoJqVP8FUzDuSHuBDEcpQ_o/edit)
