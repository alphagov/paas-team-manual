# Responding to security issues
## If you suspect a security breach

If a breach is suspected to have occurred, [alert Information Assurance (IA) immediately](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/working-at-the-white-chapel-building/security/security-incidents) to the issue and provide all required information. IA will undertake all communication with Cabinet Office's Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and any external parties as required.
